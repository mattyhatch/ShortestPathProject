How to Use:
	The program will first greet you to the game and then ask which map you would like to select. You as the user can then input a number 1-5 to select which map you would 
  like to use. You are then asked if you would like to play game mode 1 or game mode 2. Game mode 1 is the mode where the steps of the shortest path are displayed to the 
  user. As you enter game mode 1, the user will be asked whether they want to see the shortest path displayed automatically, step by step, or if they want to quit this 
  mode. The user can then enter an input and the desired action will be chosen(a for automatic, n for step by step, q to quit). In the step by step mode, the map will be 
  displayed and then the user will be prompted to enter an input either to display the next step or to quit. This will repeat until all of the steps are displayed or the 
  user decides to quit. Game mode 2 is the mode where the user gets to control the target. First, the map is displayed, then the user will be prompted to move the target 
  with WASD controls or they can press Q to quit. If they decide to move the target and there is a valid edge in the direction they choose, the target is then moved there,
  the characters will move one space closer to the target as well based off of the shortest path algorithm and the map will be displayed again. This process then repeats 
  until the user decides to quit. After quitting either of the game modes, the user will then be prompted to either repeat the program and choose a new map/gamemode or 
  they can choose to quit the program entirely.
